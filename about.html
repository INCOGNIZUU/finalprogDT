          Magic Matt has been a vendor of light up novelties, and flashing toys

          a great reputation of quality and service. Here are some references:

          Battery operated light up earrings, flashing rings, and Blinky light
          necklaces make a bold statement and make any outfit high fashion.
          These illuminated accoutrements are not just for parties, concerts,
          and clubs. In our modern world, everyone wants to be noticed. Magic
          Matt's Brilliant Blinkys let you stand out from the crowd and amaze
          your friends on special occasions or any day of the week. Boldly
          decorate yourself at night, or even during the day. Our flashing
          jewelry is so bright it even shines indoors under most artificial
          lighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          When making your purchase it is important to remember not all body
          lights are created equally. When pricing flashing jewelry, make sure
          you are not comparing apples to oranges. Don't get stuck with inferior
          products. Some lights have such short threads that you won't be able
          to turn them off without the cap popping off and the batteries falling
          out. Others have defects where the threads are too tight to turn on
          and the batteries are so small they run out in no time. Magic Matt's
          Brilliant Blinkys only carries the highest quality products. Your
          satisfaction is guaranteed.<br />
          Flashing led jewelry is great for wedding lights, neon party lights,
          and it makes great rave equipment. With a flashing pin you can have a
          light flashing on every part of your body. Magic Matt's is the place
          for wholesale light up body jewelry.
